## **Slide 2: The Global Problem**

### **Supply Chain Crisis Statistics**
- **$2.6 Trillion** lost annually due to supply chain disruptions
- **70%** of consumers demand transparency in product origins
- **85%** of companies lack complete supply chain visibility
- **60%** of sustainability claims are unverified or misleading

### **The Hidden Cost**
- **Carbon emissions** are often underestimated or hidden
- **Forced labor** and unethical practices go undetected
- **Counterfeit products** infiltrate legitimate supply chains
- **Regulatory compliance** is fragmented and inconsistent

---

## **Slide 3: What We're Solving**

### **The Core Problems**
1. **❌ No Real-Time Tracking**
   - Products disappear into "black boxes" after manufacturing
   - No visibility into component origins or carbon impact

2. **❌ Fragmented Data**
   - Information scattered across multiple systems
   - No single source of truth for sustainability data

3. **❌ Trust Issues**
   - Unverifiable sustainability claims
   - Greenwashing undermines genuine efforts

4. **❌ Regulatory Challenges**
   - Complex ESG reporting requirements
   - Inconsistent carbon accounting standards
